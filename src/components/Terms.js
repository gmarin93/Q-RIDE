                            <p className="about-text">
                                A deposit of an amount equivalent to 20% of the total reported price will be required to proceed to confirm your reservations. The amount of the final balance must be received by Que ride within 30 days prior to the arrival date at the starting point of your trip. If the payment of the final balance is not received within the indicated period, Que ride reserves the right to cancel the reservations. Those contracts made less than 30 days prior to the arrival date at the starting point of your trip, must be paid in full before the arrival date.
                                You have the possibility to pay by credit card (Visa or MasterCard) or by bank transfer.
                                Payments made by bank transfer do not receive any kind of surcharge. Que ride will take as payment for the contracted services, the amount effectively credited to your bank account free of transfer costs charged by issuing banks and correspondents. Any difference that may arise, it will be the client's responsibility to settle it through the available payment methods.

                                In case you need to cancel a reservation that is confirmed more than 30 days prior to the arrival date, you are entitled to a refund of the amount paid less the sum of 15,000 colones as a cancellation charge. If you have paid less than 15,000 colones, we will not be entitled to any refund.
                                In case you need to cancel a reservation that is confirmed between 30 and 21 days prior to the arrival date, the cancellation fee will be equivalent to 20% of the total price of the contracted services.

                            <p className="about-text">
                                All prices are subject to changes and variations. In the event of an eventual fluctuation of prices, rates, taxes, or any other item that affects the part of the total price of the services contracted, Que ride undertakes to communicate a fluctuation variation as far in advance as possible.
                                Changes and/or variations in prices caused by the reasons indicated in the preceding paragraph require payment by customers/passengers prior to the start of the contracted services.

                                Due to the fact that in general reservations are made with a significant advance, eventually, the need could arise to make variations or modifications in the contracted services. In such a case you will be notified about such changes in price, route, itinerary, hotel, transportation, etc. If such variation or modification generates any inconvenience that makes the use of the contracted services impossible, you will not be obliged to go ahead with the reservation and you will be entitled to a refund of the amount paid.
                                Que ride reserves the right to change and/or cancel already confirmed reservations due to issues related to security, adverse weather conditions, or other operational issues. You will be notified of such changes as far in advance as possible. If the changes in the already confirmed reservations generate any inconvenience that makes the use of the contracted services impossible, you will not be obliged to go ahead with the reservation and you will be entitled to a refund of the amount paid.
                                Que ride, its employees, collaborators and/or associated companies will not be obliged to make any compensation when the modifications or cancellations are made for reasons of fortuitous event or force majeure (war, terrorism, state of siege, natural or nuclear disasters, epidemics, quarantines, customs or medical regulations, fires, labor disputes or strikes, etc.). Neither will there be any responsibility on the part of Que ride and/or its collaborators and/or employees and/or associated companies for problems caused by technical failures, delays or cancellation of flights, or for travel changes due to health or safety reasons of the customers/passengers.
